## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- **Location matters most:** District proximity to business or tourist hubs strongly influences price.  
- **Professional hosts** dominate the luxury segment and maintain higher average prices.  
- **Short-term stays** are the core of the Bangkok Airbnb market; long minimum nights reduce visibility and customer base.  
- **Guest engagement** (reviews) is not directly tied to price â€” suggesting guests prioritize affordability.  
- **Luxury segment** operates under a different logic: fewer listings but much higher price ceilings.
